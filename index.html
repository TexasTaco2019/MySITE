                <strong>HTML</strong> stands for
                <em><strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
          <strong>L</strong>anguage</em
        >. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and
        describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).

    <div>
      <p>
        <strong>CSS</strong> is designed to enable the separation of
        presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This
        separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility
        and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable
        multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in
        a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
        structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the
        page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
        formatting.

    <div>
      <p>
        <strong>JavaScript </strong>is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled
        language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic
        typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
        It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and
        imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces
        (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
        structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

                This is a collection of guitars I have presently. I have seven guitars in the collection. The Gibson B45-12 string was a guitar my father bought for me when I was a 7th grader. I loved to play and I am sure made it somehting my parents wished I would
                not because I played continuously. My father paid what was then for our family alot of money for me to get that guitar. I will never let go of that guitar.
